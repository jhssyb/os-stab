Updated Orr-Sommerfeld solvers for gfortran 

  conte.f     Solves OS for channel using Godunov-Conte shooting
  contebl.f   Solve Blasius and then OS for boundary layer using Conte
  bl.f        Spectral collocation solver for Blasius equation
  orrsom.f    Similar to contebl.f
  shoot.f     Collection of general routines
  orrspace.f  Solves spatial problem for boundary layers

Numerous updates in this version include:

  1. Fixed bug in eigenfunction values at nstep
  2. Improved orthonormalization criteria
  3. Switch from IMSL to LAPACK (need to test still)
  4. Updated to support gfortran in makefile
  5. Added scripts for gnuplot output
  6. Improved some inline documentation
  7. Use OpenBLAS for numerical linear algebra
  8. Works on Mac OS-X (Darwin)

Incompressible Orr--Sommerfeld Solvers for Channel flow and Blasius Boundary
Layer.  Also bl.f is a spectral blasius flow solver.

I have updated the following codes to use LAPack routines

orrncbl.f	This finds the neutral curve for Boundary layer and
		channel profiles

orrcolchan.f	Solve Orr-Sommerfeld for channel profile
